            This is the first day of the 100 day challenge as well as the first day that I've even
            looked at React code, and I feel pretty optimistic about this. Granted I am very early 
            in the process, I feel like I understand how components kinda fit together. It reminds 
            of widgets in Flutter, so its not too too foreign to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first resource I'm using to learn React is the official Tutorial that walks you 
            through a little tic-tac-toe project with React as basically a crash course in components. 
            I feel like I'm kinda just nodding through the tutorial without really learning how to 
            write the code, but after this I'm gonna see about either using a free YouTube course 
            or Udemy course to get deeper into the framework.
